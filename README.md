# sjuapp
**Dependencies**
FastAPI (for testing)
Uvicorn (for testing)

# Importing
for importing, we import:
pip install fastapi,
and pip install uvicorn

# Clarity
We will use _pylint_
# Unit Testing
We will use _pytest_ for this, and construct unit tests for each API.

# Front End
Will be created with _Flutter_, since it is a very easy to use for front end, and it is created by Google, whose APIs we are using for our location services.
Flutter can also export for different operating systems, allowing us to easily become cross-platform.
